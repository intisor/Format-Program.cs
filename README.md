# Format-Program.cs-
 FormatProgramCs is a PowerShell script that reformats Program.cs in .NET projects, organizing builder. and app. chained calls into a clean, readable format with proper indentation. It preserves semicolons, lambda blocks, and removes consecutive blank lines, but has a quirk where app. may be stripped from some chained calls.
